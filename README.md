# Hector-Ibarra-Portfolio

## Description

- My motivation to make this project was to be able to display my work.
- I built this project to be able to make it easier for possible employers to see insight on my self and projects ive worked on.
- My Hector-Ibarra-Portfolio tackles the problem of having to search for all my work and just having it in one easy to use location.


## Installation

Its an easy process to use, you just need to search the link and you will arrive at the homescreen.

## Usage

It is a webpage so you are able to surf through it like you would any other page. You have links at the top I did provide to get to the location you would like to see alot quicker.
